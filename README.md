# ðŸš— Vehicle Management System (OOP in Python)

This is a simple Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) based project in Python that demonstrates core OOP concepts like:

- Class and Object
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Access Modifiers (Public, Protected, Private)
- Constructor (`__init__`)

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

The project defines a base abstract class `Vehicle` and two derived classes `Car` and `Bike`. It simulates basic operations like starting/stopping the engine and displaying vehicle details.

## ðŸ§© OOP Concepts Used

| Concept          | Usage Example                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Class & Object   | `Vehicle`, `Car`, `Bike`, `car1`, etc. |
| Inheritance      | `Car` and `Bike` inherit from `Vehicle`|
| Abstraction      | `display_info()` is an abstract method |
| Encapsulation    | `__engine_status` is a private variable |
| Polymorphism     | Overridden `display_info()` methods     |
| Access Modifiers | `public`, `protected`, and `private` used|
